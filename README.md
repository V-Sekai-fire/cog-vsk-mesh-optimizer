## cog-meshoptimizer

`cog-meshoptimizer` is a tool to optimize 3D assets for efficient rendering and transmission. It uses various algorithms to reduce the size and complexity of 3D models while preserving visual quality.

### Features

- Mesh simplification
- Vertex cache optimization
- Overdraw optimization
- Vertex quantization

### Usage

To optimize a 3D model, use the `cog predict` command with the appropriate input file:

```bash
cog predict -i model_file=@slavic_girl_brown_hair.glb
```
